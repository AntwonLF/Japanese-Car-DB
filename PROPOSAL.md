# Project Proposal

## Project Choice 

- [ ] Japanese Car DB

## Project Description 

This project involves developing a backend CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that provides a comprehensive API for car information, complemented by a frontend designed as a virtual car meet. Users can access and manage data about various car makes and models, including details like year and specifications. The application is built using Node.js and Express for server-side operations, with MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose for database schema definition and interaction. Key features include the ability to add new car entries, retrieve car details, update existing information, and delete entries, all within an engaging virtual environment where car enthusiasts can explore and connect. The API and frontend interactions will be rigorously tested using tools like Postman or Insomnia. Additional features may include user authentication and enhanced data handling with filtering, sorting, and pagination, enhancing the virtual car meet experience.
